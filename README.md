Using the GeoJSON API

In this program you will use a GeoLocation lookup API modelled after the Google API to look up some universities and parse the returned data.

This is my assigment to Course 'Using Python to Access Web Data' made by Dr.Chuck for Coursera from University of Michigan. I highly suggest you to try and make for yourself the code because that's how you can learn something new and understand mode about Python.
